🎯 Goal-Oriented Smart Timetable Generator
📌 Project Overview

The Goal-Oriented Smart Timetable Generator is an intelligent, adaptive, and student-centric scheduling system designed to address the limitations of traditional rigid timetables. In modern academic environments, students often struggle with dynamically changing deadlines, varying workloads, and evolving learning priorities. Static schedules fail to accommodate these changes, resulting in poor time management, incomplete goals, and increased academic stress.

This system introduces an automated, algorithm-driven approach to personalized timetable generation. By integrating subjects, syllabus scope, deadlines, available study hours, task priorities, and individual learning preferences, the application generates an optimized and flexible study plan tailored to each student’s needs.

Unlike conventional planners, this system dynamically recalculates and reorganizes schedules whenever new tasks are added or deadlines shift, ensuring continuity without disrupting the overall academic workflow.

🧠 Core Concept

The project is built upon intelligent scheduling strategies, primarily:

Priority Scheduling Algorithm

Dynamic Adjustment Techniques

The system analyzes urgency, difficulty level, academic importance, and available time slots to generate a structured timetable. When changes occur — such as delayed tasks or newly added assignments — the algorithm automatically recalculates only the necessary portions of the schedule, preserving stability and minimizing disruption.

This makes the system adaptive, responsive, and goal-driven rather than static and reactive.

⚙️ System Architecture

The application follows a modular and scalable architecture:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: Python (Flask/Django)

Database: MySQL

Future Expansion: React Native / Flutter (Mobile App with Notifications)

The frontend provides a clean and intuitive interface for student input and timetable visualization.
The backend processes scheduling logic and communicates with the MySQL database to store and retrieve user-specific academic data securely.
